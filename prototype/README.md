# Visual prototype for bypeople

Open `prototype/index.html` in your browser to review the static visual prototype for the signup flow and portfolio uploader. The uploader is a mock — it simulates client-side previews and a successful upload without making network requests. To share a live preview quickly, enable GitHub Pages on branch `feature/prototype` (Settings → Pages → Branch: feature/prototype / root) and visit the provided URL.

If you want I can also open a pull request with these files or deploy the prototype branch for you.
